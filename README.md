Morsetrainer is a project I created for my personal use to, of course, practice Morse code. I realize there already exist programs I could trivially find online for this purpose, but this is more interesting. It's also coding practice and vim practice.

Feel free to use, modify, or distribute, as long as you don't claim my code as your own.
